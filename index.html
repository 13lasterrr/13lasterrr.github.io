        <p><b>Hello everyone<b/>
I'm 20 years old Professional Gamer from Pakistan trying to achieve my goals, currently playing for Team Zealous EAP. I've been playing DOTA 2 since 2015/16. If you have any questions, hit me up!</p>

        <h1>AboutMe</h1>
        <p>In the world of e-sports, everyone is constantly striving to improve. But are you moving n the right direction? Do you want to stand among the best? If so, look no further!

My name is Abdullah, aka 13lasterrr, and I truly love DotA2. I'm a well-rounded player with competitive experience in every role and a history stretching back to the Warcraft mod days, so I'm more than familiar with any hero you'd like to learn! Choosing me as a coach means assistance from someone with years of pro insight to draw upon and a deep understanding of the core mechanics that make DotA such an incredible game.

My lessons combine analysis (patch changelogs, hero advantages / disadvantages, matchups, replays, etc) with practical advice on how to pick and counterpick, survive (and win!) your lane, maintain map awareness, farm efficiently, and make the key strategic decisions that will lead you to victory!

With years of experience in coaching, I have a unique coaching method that has proven results with 100% of the students I have tested it with. This coaching method is applicable to all mmr brackets. I highly recommend your first session being 2 hours in length so we can identify core issues in your gameplay, and help you understand what is needed to reach your goals.

I Coach all Regions and Roles and have a vast amount of experience coaching professional teams.

Challenge the status quo. Become one of the best. What are you waiting for?</p>
